  When I hear the word <em>angst</em> I think of existential dread. I don't like the word because it's so often used pejoratively, meant to indicate someone's immaturity. But I still very much empathize with the anger, frustration, and despair I felt as a kid. I wasn't wrong about anything, I still believe all the same things, I just don't react emotionally to it anymore or let it control my life. That's not because I came to any kind of comfortable conclusion–I'm pretty firmly entrenched in existential nihilism–I just struggled against things for long enough that I've slowly become numb and would rather ignore the whole subject instead. That was already true by the time I went to university.

  I think if there is one thing I associate most with youth, and the thing I miss most, is the strong emotional reactions I would have to things. Learning something interesting, exploring a new place, listening to a beautiful song… I don't think I experience those things the same way anymore. Even my depression has changed: I remember feeling the most intense, gut-wrenching despair. While I still feel some sadness, these days it mostly manifests as a kind of numbed boredom with my life and the world. I don't know if this deterioration in my experience is something I can actually attribute to age, or if it is just a symptom of my chronic depression.
