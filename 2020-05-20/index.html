  People used to build nice things, things that lasted a long time. Things like castles and churches and pyramids that are still standing today. It seems that we mostly stopped doing that in the last 200 years or so. Which is odd, considering how mechanization should have made building nice things a lot faster and easier.
<p>
  I finished watching a series of videos by a boatbuilder ("shipwright"), who is rebuilding a historic, neglected yacht: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg-_lYeV8hBnDSay7nmphUA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg-_lYeV8hBnDSay7nmphUA</a>. He's spent 3 years on the project, working like 16 hour days, and he's probably not even halfway done. His youtube channel has yielded him dozens of volunteers, which visit him for months at a time sometimes in teams as large as 8, helping him work on his boat for free. He's spent maybe $80,000 USD on (rough-sawn) wood already, and he still needs a lot more materials. His family friends have provided him the space and a giant woodshop which he would otherwise have to pay a fortune for. Through his Youtube channel, he has amassed a small fortune in monthly donations, which he's now using to hire another shipwright to help him on the project.
<p>
  Still, he's devoting many years of his youth being overworked, and all he gets at the end of it is a nice yacht. Given its history (although he's replaced every single piece of wood on it already) and the story of how he built it, that is pretty cool, and of course it'll be worth a pretty penny by the end of it all. But had he not seen so much success with his channel, and had the stars not aligned, I can't imagine he'd ever have been able to do it. It probably would have taken him like 15 years of his life and every single penny. There is another Youtube channel where 2 guys are doing something similar, and they've also gotten huge numbers of volunteers and Patreon dollars, but they're much less skilled than he is and have been at it for almost 5 years, yet are not as far as him (and their boat doesn't look nearly as well done).
<p>
  Although he uses hand tools for much of the joinery, he mostly uses a large chainsaw, a ship saw (a giant bandsaw that can alter its angle mid-cut, needing two people to operate), a 16" circular saw, a table saw, large thickness planer, large jointer, and a large variety of handheld electric planers that take away massive amounts of material. Back in the Age of Exploration and the Age of Sail, people pumped out massive wooden boats, the likes of which haven't been built in hundreds of years. And they did it all with handsaws, hand planes, chisels, axes, and adzes. It must have taken hundreds of shipwrights years to build those monstrous ships, only to have them blown to bits by cannonballs within the first few years of their life.
<p>
  I don't really understand the economics of how thousands of skilled labourers could come together in years past for decades at a time and build something timeless.
