  Yesterday I had the whole day to myself as my brother was extremely busy, and I'm visiting him in Utrecht for the week. In the morning I biked to Houten, my place of birth. I made an embarrassing mistake on the bike path and ended up biking on a road I was not supposed to be on, with many onlookers at a bus stop staring at me while I corrected my mistake.

  The rest of the day was spent walking around downtown Utrecht, where I grew increasingly unhappy as I found myself unable to enter shops or restaurants out of anxiety. That made me depressed for the rest of the day.

  Today I have no motivation to any of the things on my list. I hate spending any time on the computer but it is the only thing I can bear doing.
