  If I don't distract myself I just sit there in misery. Like this weekend at the campsite I mostly just sat on some rocks and was miserable. I don't know that there is much to analyze; I mostly just think about how everything that's good in life takes effort, how the "cure" for my condition is essentially just to start working really hard at relationships, at my health, and at my goals, but I've consistently avoided putting in any effort on those things my entire life and I'm just too tired of trying and failing. I just don't have any confidence in myself that I'm going to change at this point and gain the willpower to work hard at these things. And giving up just feels like the only realistic outcome.
