  I'm in this kinda dangerous loop where I fantasize about starting over. Like if I could just go back 15 years armed with the knowledge I have now, I could put myself on a different trajectory and really make the most of my youth. I could take more social risks and mold my personality into that person I've always wanted to be, who is so very different from who I actually am. I would go on an adventure every weekend and take Michael up on every crazy idea we could conjure. I would try in school and get myself a scholarship, and spend my first summer of college tree planting instead of being completely broken over one dumb relationship.

  I get so embroiled in these fantasies that coming back to reality is an incredibly painful thing. I've always had these kinds of fantasies, but they weren't always painful. When I was in elementary school I would imagine myself as a teenager, and map out all these accomplishments and things I saw as leading a perfect life. But as my real life drifted further and further from my fantasies, and I started missing the imaginary milestones I had set for myself, I would double down by extending the timelines and increasing the scope of my ambitions. The glaring reality about how my life was unfolding versus how I was imagining things subconsciously caused me a ton of anxiety, so to cope I would just fantasize more often and for longer. It was an escape for me; I could fool myself into thinking that my life was going to be great for little bits at a time.

  At some point in my mid-twenties there was a distinct changeâ€“I stopped fantasizing about the future and instead focused entirely on the past. I guess I could no longer convince myself that I could still turn things around and be this person I wanted to be. It was getting too late to go back to school and get all the degrees I wanted, and I'd shown myself I couldn't hack it anyway. It was too late to get good at a sport and compete with the best. I was too old to relive the quintessential college experience that I felt I didn't make the most of. So instead I now fantasize about my past self, imagining all the instances I could have said "yes" instead of "no", and how I could have taught myself to be someone different.
