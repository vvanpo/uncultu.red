  Yesterday I spent the day walking around Paris with my brother. I spent little time thinking about my depression, as most of my thought was spent on marvelling at the city and the vast displays of artwork within. This was quite a change from the week before, which I spent lamenting over my inability to motivate myself to get out of the house and explore. I spent most of that week sleeping the days away, because I could not bear doing anything else.

  Having my brother along was quite a help, and we talked about a lot of different subjects.

  But now that I've returned, I find that the high has faded and I once again have little energy to do things that might make this trip worthwhile.
