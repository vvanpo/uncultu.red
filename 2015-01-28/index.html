  I can't seem to figure out what is worth doing. It seems that almost anything I would like to be doing, I want to do for all the wrong reasons. Things like creative writing, reading, drawing, painting, and even travelling, seem like they should be things one does for pleasure. But I don't feel like I actually enjoy these things; instead I think I only want to do them for the recognition it could get me.

  I want to be worldly and have lots of crazy experiences... but mostly for the stories I can then tell to the envious ear of others.
<p>
  I want to be well-read... but mostly to impress others with my knowledge.
<p>
  I want to create beautiful artwork... but mostly for the praise and fame.

  I started reading a book about Latin American history again after having taken a few months off from it. The book is crammed full of lots of interesting facts, but I realized I couldn't even really remember a single one of these facts from the first half of the book—only the very vague, general idea (which was anti-colonialism). It was very hard for me to motivate myself to read this book, so why bother if I'm just going to forget almost everything about it?

  The same goes for school—I can barely remember any of the things I learned (and worked very hard on learning) about physics and math only a couple years ago. If the pursuit of knowledge has been my primary goal for most of my life, but I can't retain any knowledge, what should I really be spending my time on?
